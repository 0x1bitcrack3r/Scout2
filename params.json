{"name":"Scout2","tagline":"Security auditing tool for AWS environments","body":"## Description\r\n\r\nUsing the AWS API, the Scout2 Python scripts fetches EC2, IAM, and S3, configuration data. The gathered configuration is analyzed and stored as JSON objects in several JavaScript files. These files are imported in the Scout2 HTML report, which allows for a quick and efficient review of the AWS configuration.\r\n\r\n## HTML Report\r\n\r\nThe Scout2 Python script populates JavaScript variables displayed in the HTML report. In addition to displaying the AWS configuration, the AWS Scout2 HTML report highlights high-risk areas automatically. Potential findings are highlight with two different colors\r\n * red :: danger\r\n * orange :: warning\r\n\r\n### EC2 view\r\n\r\nSecurity Groups are the first layer of defense for EC2 instances ([AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html#VPC_Security_Comparison)), and control both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. AWS Scout2 has a default ruleset that reports known sensitive ports that are open to the Internet (in the following screenshot, 22/SSH). Additionally, the default ruleset also reports open ports whose number are associated with plaintext protocol (in the following screenshot, 23/Telnet).\r\n\r\n![EC2 Security Groups](http://isecpartners.github.io/Scout2/images/aws-screenshot-ec2-sg.png)\r\n\r\nNetwork ACLs are the second layer of defense, and control traffic in and out of a subnet. AWS Scout2 has an EC2/Network ACLs view that reports all existing rules:\r\n\r\n![Network ACLs view](http://isecpartners.github.io/Scout2/images/aws-screenshot-ec2-acls.png)\r\n\r\n### IAM view\r\n\r\nThe IAM tab in the HTML report allows to review IAM users, groups and roles. In the following screenshot, AWS Scout2 reports two dangerous findings (lack of Multi-Factor Authentication, lack of access-key rotation), and warns about a third one (support for two types of authentication).\r\n\r\n![Apps](http://isecpartners.github.io/Scout2/images/aws-screenshot-iam-user.png)\r\n\r\n### S3 view\r\n\r\nAWS Scout2 fetches the S3 configuration as well. The default ruleset highlights buckets that are world-writable, and whose permissions are world-writable. Additionally, a warning is displayed for world-readable buckets.\r\n\r\n![Apps](http://isecpartners.github.io/Scout2/images/aws-screenshot-s3-worldwrite.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Default rulesets\r\n\r\nAWS Scout2 comes with the following, default, rulset:\r\n\r\n### EC2 default ruleset\r\n<table width=\"100%\">\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"75%\">Sensitive port open to the Internet (e.g. SSH, RDP, SQL, ...)</td>\r\n  <td width=\"25%\" style=\"color:red\"><font color=\"red\">danger</font></td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"75%\">Plaintext-protocol port open (e.g. FTP, Telnet, ...)</td>\r\n  <td width=\"25%\" style=\"color:red !important\">danger</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"75%\">Non-HTTP ports open to the Internet (not 80/443)</td>\r\n  <td width=\"25%\" style=\"color:orange\">danger</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### IAM default ruleset\r\n\r\n### S3 default ruleset\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to create a new rule\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n* Loic Simon - @l01cd3v","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
