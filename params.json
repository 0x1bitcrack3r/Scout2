{"name":"Scout2","tagline":"AWS auditing tool","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?

Using the AWS API, Scout2 gathers configuration data for\r\nmanual inspection and highlights high-risk areas automatically. Rather than\r\npouring through dozens of pages on the web, Scout2 supplies a clear view of the\r\nattack surface automatically.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Scout2 is still under development. It is currently usable, but a\r\nnumber of features may change. As such, please bear with us as we find time to\r\nwork on the tool. Feel free to report a bug with details, request a new feature,\r\nor send a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install Scout2, simply clone this repository.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of required python modules that may not be installed on\r\nyour system:\r\n\r\n* Boto, Amazon's AWS SDK for Python (https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforpython)\r\n* Dateutil (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nTo run Scout2, you will need valid AWS credentials (Access Key). The role, or\r\nuser account, associated with this Access Key needs to have read access on all\r\nresources within:\r\n\r\n* Identity and Access Management (IAM)\r\n* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\r\n* Simple Storage Service (S3)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo run Scout2 using an access key downloaded from AWS, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ python Scout2.py --credentials <CREDENTIALS.CSV>\r\n\r\nTo run Scout2 from an EC2 instance within an appropriate IAM Role, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ python Scout2.py --role-credentials\r\n\r\nTo run Scout2 when MFA-Protected API Access is configured, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ python Scout2.py --credentials <CREDENTIALS.CSV> --mfa_serial <ARN_MFA_SERIAL_NUMBER> --mfa_code <MFA CODE>\r\n\r\nScout2 will generate a number of JavaScript files that contain AWS configuration\r\ndata stored as JSON payloads. Scout2 will also generate additional JavaScript\r\nfiles that contain potential security flaws and best practices violations. To\r\nreview the configuration, simply open the report.html file in your browser.\r\n\r\n## Advanced documentation\r\n\r\nThe following command will provide the list of available command line options:\r\n\r\n    $ python Scout2.py --help\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGPLv2: See LICENSE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
